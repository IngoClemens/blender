# Add-ons for Blender

This is an add-on collection for Blender which will be extended over time as production calls for the creation of new tools.

***If you find the add-ons useful we would appreciate if you would consider supporting us for continued development via [Gumroad](https://braverabbit.gumroad.com)***

## PickWalk
Navigate through a hierarchy of objects or bones of an armature or walk over vertices and points of meshes and curves in edit mode.
It basically copies the default pickwalking behaviour of Maya with additional selection extension and opposite side switching.

## Place Reflection
Perform a reflection-based placement of lights (or any other object) on a mesh by simply dragging the mouse over the mesh.
