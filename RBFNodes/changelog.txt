1.2.1 - 2024-11-26
      - Fixed an incompatibility issue with Blender 4.3.

1.2.0 - 2024-06-04
      - Added a preference setting to set the number of properties which
        can be used as drivers or being driven.

1.1.0 - 2023-10-17
      - Added compatibility with Blender 4.0.
      - Added a language selector with 8 languages.
      - Added an error message if stored properties don't match the
        current version of Blender.

1.0.3 - 2023-08-07
      - Fixed that shading nodes cannot be linked due to python changes
        in Blender 3.6.

1.0.2 - 2023-07-03
      - Fixed an error related to the driver or driven object missing a
        material assignment when linking an input or output node.
      - Fixed that geometry nodes with a geometry socket don't get their
        value plugs listed.

1.0.1 - 2023-06-09
      - Fixed wrong unregistering of the PointerProperty.

1.0.0 - 2023-06-08
      - Because of some necessary changes new RBF setups are not
        compatible with older versions of the add-on. A message appears
        when loading a scene which contains an older setup and the side
        panel of the RBF editor also displays a message.
        The setup is updated when the RBF solver gets reset.
      - When adding a new pose with additional shape keys default values
        are added to existing poses. This works for shape keys only
        because a value of zero can be assumed for all other poses. It
        does not work with other properties.
      - Updated node names to differentiate between inputs and outputs.
      - Activating the RBF sets all input and output nodes to
        non-editable to prevent changes during the active state.
      - Improved the interpolation when using quaternion-based rotation.
      - Improved error message when a decomposition error occurs.
      - Added a search and replace option in the developer section to
        edit driver and driven data for poses.
      - Removed quaternion based rotation sub-types.
      - Fixed that the quaternion output rotation properties are
        depending on the selected euler axes.
      - Fixed that shape key drivers remain when resetting the RBF.
      - Fixed that the individual shape-key block name of a duplicated
        mesh isn't respected when activating the RBF.
      - Fixed that the RBF calculation is using driver values with an
        offset of one frame when used in an animation.

0.4.0 - 2022-07-11
      - Improved error messages when the number of storable values gets
        exceeded.
      - Added an error label to the RBF node when activating the RBF
        fails.
      - Added a short description to assist extending the number of pose
        values.
      - Added a constant to define the number of properties to store the
        pose and weight values for better proceduralism.
      - Fixed: A pose cannot be edited after the RBF has been reset.

0.3.0 - 2022-07-06
      - Various changes and improvements.
      - Added support for object properties and modifiers.
      - Added radius presets.

0.2.0 - 2022-05-26
      - Merged all individual property sockets into one.

0.1.0 - 2022-03-24
