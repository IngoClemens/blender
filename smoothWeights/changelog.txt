        affecting the vertex count.
      - Changed the default order of pie menu items.
      - Removed the mesh properties panel location option because of
        context restrictions. The obsolete option is reset to 'Tool'.

        warning message because of invalid settings.
      - Fixed a memory issue related to switching the affected vertex
        group type.
      - Language file fixes.

        only non-deforming vertex groups.

        appears in.

      - Detection of non-manifold geometry when creating the symmetry
        map.
      - Two new operators for symmetrizing and flipping the mesh.
      - Sibling stepping for analyzing the symmetry. This requires
        extras to be enabled in the add-on preferences.
      - Code restructure
      - Easier modification of keymap preferences through a separate
        keymap file.

2.2.0 - 2023-09-12
      - Overall speed improvements.
      - Added a normalize option to the Limit Groups operator.
      - Mirroring weights now better addresses weights for vertices on
        the line of symmetry.
      - Removed the property to enable/disable the use of maximum vertex
        groups. Instead, a max groups value of zero will ignore any
        limit.

2.1.0 - 2023-09-08
      - Added the Mirror Weights operator to the Smooth Weights panel.
      - Added icons for all tool buttons.

        The selection is now limited to two edges maximum.
      - Fixed that mapping fails with simple objects if one of the faces
        has a zero index.
      - Fixed that Add Partial doesn't find center vertices if these are
        slightly on the negative side.

2.0.0 - 2023-09-07
      - Added symmetry mapping.
      - Added a symmetry option to the smooth operators to use the new
        symmetry map for mirrored smoothing.
      - Added a new operator to clamp the maximum number of vertex
        groups.
      - Added a new operator to mirror vertex weights based on the
        symmetry map.

1.2.0 - 2023-08-28
      - Added an oversampling property for smoothing in multiple
        iterations for a smoother result.
      - Added an additional color preference to control the color of the
        brush circle and the tool info separately.
      - Increased the drawing precision of the brush circle.
      - Fixed that the flood operator would not respect the current
        vertex selection.

1.1.0 - 2023-08-25
      - Disabling Use Selection also disables selection/deselection
        mode.
      - When exiting while in Blender's Weight Paint mode the mode is
        kept.
      - Fixed that undo is very slow with a large number of affected
        vertices.
      - The user defined color for unselected vertices is not used when
        entering the tool.

        mode.

      - Fixed, that the brush circle briefly appears at the last
        position when starting a new stroke.
      - Fixed the wrong display of the max groups label in the in-view
        settings.

0.0.4 - 2023-08-18
      - Improvements to the smoothing algorithm.
      - Added the option to ignore backfaces while painting.
      - Included the volume option in the floor operator.
