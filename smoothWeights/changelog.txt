2.3.0 - 2023-09-14
      - Detection of non-manifold geometry when creating the symmetry
        map.
      - Two new operators for symmetrizing and flipping the mesh.
      - Sibling stepping for analyzing the symmetry. This requires
        extras to be enabled in the add-on preferences.
      - Code restructure
      - Easier modification of keymap preferences through a separate
        keymap file.

2.2.0 - 2023-09-12
      - Overall speed improvements.
      - Added a normalize option to the Limit Groups operator.
      - Mirroring weights now better addresses weights for vertices on
        the line of symmetry.
      - Removed the property to enable/disable the use of maximum vertex
        groups. Instead, a max groups value of zero will ignore any
        limit.

2.1.0 - 2023-09-08
      - Added the Mirror Weights operator to the Smooth Weights panel.
      - Added icons for all tool buttons.
      - Fixed that mapping takes long if too many elements are selected.
        The selection is now limited to two edges maximum.
      - Fixed that mapping fails with simple objects if one of the faces
        has a zero index.
      - Fixed that Add Partial doesn't find center vertices if these are
        slightly on the negative side.

2.0.0 - 2023-09-07
      - Added symmetry mapping.
      - Added a symmetry option to the smooth operators to use the new
        symmetry map for mirrored smoothing.
      - Added a new operator to clamp the maximum number of vertex
        groups.
      - Added a new operator to mirror vertex weights based on the
        symmetry map.

1.2.0 - 2023-08-28
      - Added an oversampling property for smoothing in multiple
        iterations for a smoother result.
      - Added an additional color preference to control the color of the
        brush circle and the tool info separately.
      - Increased the drawing precision of the brush circle.
      - Fixed that the flood operator would not respect the current
        vertex selection.

1.1.0 - 2023-08-25
      - Disabling Use Selection also disables selection/deselection
        mode.
      - When exiting while in Blender's Weight Paint mode the mode is
        kept.
      - Fixed that undo is very slow with a large number of affected
        vertices.
      - The user defined color for unselected vertices is not used when
        entering the tool.

1.0.0 - 2023-08-24
      - Increased brush value precision.
      - Public release.

0.0.6 - 2023-08-23
      - Ignore islands is now enabled for volume mode.
      - Added a selection and deselection mode.
      - Added a keymap for flooding in paint mode.
      - The paint mode undo queue has now a configurable length with a
        preference setting.
      - The tool is now only accessible when in Object or Weight Paint
        mode.

0.0.5 - 2023-08-18
      - Added the ability to drag the current frame while in paint
        mode with Shift + RMB.
      - Added the corresponding keymap to the in-view settings.
      - Fixed, that the brush circle briefly appears at the last
        position when starting a new stroke.
      - Fixed the wrong display of the max groups label in the in-view
        settings.

0.0.4 - 2023-08-18
      - Improvements to the smoothing algorithm.
      - Added the option to ignore backfaces while painting.
      - Included the volume option in the floor operator.
      - Removed the oversampling property, which was needed for the old
        smoothing process.
      - Fixed some issues related to the selection switches.
      - Fixed the strength value which was not working as expected.

0.0.3 - 2023-08-16
      - The tool is now also available in Blender's Weight Paint mode.
      - The paint cursor now shows as a target cross, to match it with
        the regular paint tool.
      - Fixed an undo-paint-related issue when using the flood operator.
      - Fixed the labels in the redo panel of the floor operator.

0.0.2 - 2023-08-16
      - Added a new option to disable any selection-based restriction.
      - Added a single undo operation while in paint mode.
      - Fixed the issue that any transformation affects the
        functionality of the tool.

0.0.1 - 2023-08-15
